  The road continues from east to west where you see a few buildings.  The slight breeze carries away the smell of fish wafting in from the east where you see many stalls.  To the north, the shorten docks drop off in a jagged rock cliff that provides a barrier against the crashing waves.  To your south is a small, fenced-in park.
